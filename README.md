# Pandas-challenge

Codes used in this challenge were all based on the class activity lessons/practices, I did asked for help from my instructor with one of the errors I was getting while using the bin and pd.cut() method.

In this challenge we were tasked to to analyze the district-wide standardized test results of a city's school district dataset called <b> PyCitySchools </b>.
(the dataset is provided by edX Boot Camps LLC )

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data:

<b> District SUmmary </b>
Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

<b> School Summary </b>
School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

<b> Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) </b>
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

<b> Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) </b>
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

<b> Math Scores by Grade </b>
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

<b> Reading Scores by Grade </b>
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

<b> Scores by School Spending </b>
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.
